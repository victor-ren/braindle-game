# Braindle

Braindle is a daily mental workout game which combines three core cognitive challenges: mathematics, riddles, and pattern recognition. 
Each day, players delve into a new set of puzzles designed to stimulate different areas of the brain, fueling both logical and creative thinking.

## Features

* Daily Challenge: Each day, players are presented with a unique set of three puzzles—a math puzzle, a riddle, and a pattern recognition challenge. These puzzles change every 24 hours.
* Problem Solving: Players use logic and creativity to solve the math puzzle, which can range from arithmetic to more complex mathematical problems.
* Riddle Decoding: Players test their linguistic and lateral thinking skills by unraveling the daily riddle, which requires understanding of language, problem solving skills, and thinking outside the box.
* Pattern Identification: In the pattern recognition puzzle, players analyze visual patterns or sequences and determine the missing pieces or the next sequence.
* Hints and Tips: If stuck, players can access hints for a step in the right direction.
* Music: Players can toggle background music to enhance their gameplay experience and get them in a thinking mood.
* Leaderboards: Players can compare their daily scores with friends and the wider “Braindle” community on global leaderboards.
* Achievements: Players earn achievements and badges for reaching specific milestones, such as completing a set number of consecutive puzzles or achieving high scores.
* Progress: Visual graphs display the player’s progress over time, showing improvements in speed and accuracy. Players can also track their daily scores and streaks.

### Work in Progress

* Friends: Players can add their friends to track each other's progress and compete together.
